# Life_Guard_Gloves
We attach the sensors like DS18B20 Temperature sensor, Flex sensor , Vibration motor, Heart beat sensor, MQ5 gas sensor to the gloves, we used Arduino uno and jumper wires. In the cloud side we used the Google Firebase to receive and sync the data of the patient.

- For the problem, we had made gloves for the patient. These gloves are worn by the patient who is in ICU. These gloves will detect the data like a heartbeat, body temperature, gases, and flex.
- These detected data will send to the doctor’s device, nurse’s device, and the patient’s device through the cloud(Firebase) and mobile application. If the data is critical, it gives an alert message to the doctor, nurse, and attended, and also the dynamic data is continuously shared to all.
- These will reduce them patient death rate in the ICU. We also used the data set of the patient. This system will also predict the patient's future data, so we used the Sentimental algorithm and data set in this project.
- In the future, if a person will have heart attack means, Our project will be identified that in the present itself because the data set is dynamically linked with the past data set and the health condition of the patient.
